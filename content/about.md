I am Utkarsh, a 20 y/o undergrad student! üë®‚Äçüéì

Besides being a full-time student, I am an open source advocate, a software
developer, and a somewhat-polyglot developer.

I am also a **Debian core developer**, maintaining & working on over 900+
packages (written in C, C++, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Go, and Perl),
including some key packages like the Ruby interpreter, Rails, GitLab, some
Python libraries, Micro, and libgit2. Besides, I also co-maintain the
[fasttrack.debian.net](https://fasttrack.debian.net/) service & act as an
[FTP Traine](https://ftp-master.debian.org/).

I was [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) student
twice (once in [2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/6014695855620096/)
and then in [2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/4736285727522816/),
both times in Debian, where I authored my "baby" project,
[RuboCop::Packaging](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging), which
is a linter and an auto-corrector, written in Ruby, helping downstream Ruby
teams (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, et al).

And finally, I work on **Debian LTS**, a project by Freexian, extending the
lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years, where I patch
and backport security fixes for packages in the APT archive for oldstable
and oldoldstable releases.

Besides, I am a philatelist, a semi-occassional drummer, an avid reader,
and have perhaps mastered the art of sticker fights!

Please feel free to hit me up if you want to get in contact or want to know
more about me. I go by the handle **utkarsh2102** across the web! \o/
