Here's my (ninth) monthly update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 16th month of contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March last year and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) last Christmas! \o/  

This month was a little intense. I did a a lot of different kinds of things in Debian this month. Whilst most of my time went on doing security stuff, I also sponosred a bunch of packages.

Here are the following things I did this month:

#### Uploads and bug fixes:

- [rails](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rails) (2:5.2.4.3+dfsg-1) - fix a bunch of [CVEs](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/rails) in Sid and Bullseye.

## GSoC Phase 1, Part 2!
![](/images/debian_ruby.png#center)

Last month, I got selected as a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) student for [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) again! \o/  
I am working on the [Upstream-Downstream Cooperation in Ruby](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2020/Projects/#SummerOfCode2020.2FApprovedProjects.2FUpstreamDownstreamCooperationInRuby.Upstream.2FDownstream_cooperation_in_Ruby) project.

The first half of the first month is blogged here, titled, [GSoC Phase 1](https://utkarsh2102.com/posts/gsoc-phase-1/).  
Also, I log daily updates at [gsocwithutkarsh2102.tk](https://gsocwithutkarsh2102.tk/).

Whilst the daily updates are available at the above site^, Iâ€™ll breakdown the important parts of the later half of the first month here:

- Documented the first cop, `GemspecGit` via [PR #2](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/pull/2).
- Made an initial release, [v0.1.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/rubocop-packaging)! ðŸ’–
- Spread the word/usage about this tool/library via adding them in the official [RuboCop docs](https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/extensions.html).
- We had our [third weekly meeting](https://gsocwithutkarsh2102.tk/log/2020/06/18/day18.html) where we discussed the next steps and the things that are supposed to be done for the next set of cops.
- Wrote more tests so as to cover different aspects of the `GemspecGit` cop.
- Opened [PR #4](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/pull/4/) for the next Cop, `RequireRelativeToLib`.
- Introduced [rubocop-packaging](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging) to the outer world and requested other upstream projects to use it! It is being used by 6 other projects already ðŸ˜­ðŸ’–
- Had our [fourth weekly meeting](https://gsocwithutkarsh2102.tk/log/2020/06/25/day25.html) where we pair-programmed (and I sucked :P) and figured out a way to make the second cop work.
- Found a bug, reported at [issue #5](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/issues/5) and raised [PR #6](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/pull/6) to fix it.
- And finally, people loved the library/tool (and it's outcome):

![](/images/pboling-comment.png#center)  
(for those who don't know, [@bbatsov](https://github.com/bbatsov) is the author of [RuboCop](https://rubocop.org/), [@lienvdsteen](https://gitlab.com/lienvdsteen) is an amazing fullstack engineer at GitLab, and [@pboling](https://github.com/pboling) is the author of some awesome Ruby tools and libraries!)

Thank you for sticking along for so long :)  

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
