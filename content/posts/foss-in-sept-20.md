Here's my (twelfth) monthly update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 21st month of contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March last year and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) last Christmas! \o/

I've been busy with my undergraduation stuff but I still squeezed out some time for regular Debian work.

Anyway, here are the following things I did in Debian this month:

#### Uploads and bug fixes:

- [rails](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rails) (2:6.0.3.3+dfsg-1) - Fixing [CVE-2020-15169](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-15169)/[bug #970040](https://bugs.debian.org/970040).
- [ruby-openid-connect](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-openid-connect) (1.1.8-1) - New upstream version, v1.1.8.

#### Other $things:
