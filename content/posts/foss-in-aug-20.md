Here's my (eleventh) monthly update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 20th month of contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March last year and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) last Christmas! \o/

Well, this month we had [DebConf](https://debconf20.debconf.org/)! \o/  
(more about this later this week!)

Anyway, here are the following things I did in Debian this month:

#### Uploads and bug fixes:

- [rubocop](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rubocop) (0.89.1+dfsg-1) - New upstream version for `RuboCop::Packaging`.  
- [ruby-rubocop-ast](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-rubocop-ast) (0.3.0+dfsg-1) - New upstream version for `RuboCop`'s latest version.  
- [ruby-rubocop-packaging](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-rubocop-packaging) (0.3.0-1) - Shouldn't check `lib/` and `gemspec` file.  
- [bidi-clojure](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/bidi-clojure) (2.1.3-1) - New upstream version for [`Puppet6`](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Puppet/Work).
- Source-only uploads for [ruby-anima](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-anima), [ruby-uniform-notifier](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-uniform-notifier), [ruby-unparser](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-unparser), [ruby-morpher](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-morpher), and [ruby-path-expander](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-path-expander).

#### Other $things:

- Mentoring for newcomers.
- FTP Trainee reviewing.
- Moderation of -project mailing list.
- Sponsored `php-dasprid-enum` and `php-bacon-baconqrcode` for William and `ruby-unparser`, `ruby-morpher`, and `ruby-path-exapander` for Cocoa.

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
