Hello,

In early May, I got selected as a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
student for [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) to work on a  project which is to write a linter
(an extension to [RuboCop](https://rubocop.org/)).  
This tool is mostly to help the [Debian Ruby team](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Ruby/).
And that is the best part, I love working in/for/with the Ruby team!  
(I've been an active part of the team for 19 months now :))

More details about the project can be found [here, on the wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2020/Projects/#SummerOfCode2020.2FApprovedProjects.2FUpstreamDownstreamCooperationInRuby.Upstream.2FDownstream_cooperation_in_Ruby).  
And also, I have got the best mentors I could've possibly asked for: [Antonio Terceiro](https://github.com/terceiro)
and [David RodrÃ­guez](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/) ðŸ’–


So, the program began on 1st June and I've been working since then. I log my daily updates at
[gsocwithutkarsh2102.tk](https://gsocwithutkarsh2102.tk/).  
The blog for the first part of phase 1 can be found [here](https://utkarsh2102.com/posts/gsoc-phase-1/)
and that of second part of phase 1 can be found [here](https://utkarsh2102.com/posts/foss-in-june-20/).

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
