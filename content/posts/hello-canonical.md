Today marks the **90th** day of me joining Canonical to work on Ubuntu full-time! So since
it's been a while already, this blog post is long due. :)


## The News

I joined [Canonical](https://canonical.com/), this February, to work on Ubuntu full-time! \o/  
Those who know, they know that this is really very exciting for me because Canonical has
been a dream company for me, for real (more about this below!). And hey, this is my first
job, **ever**, so all the more reason to be psyched about, isn't it? ^_^

P.S. Keep reading and we'll meet my *squad* really sooon!

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
