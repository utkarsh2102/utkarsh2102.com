Today marks the **90th** day of me joining Canonical to work on Ubuntu full-time! So since
it's been a while already, this blog post is long due. :)


## The News
{{< figure src="/images/canonical-small-logo.png" >}}

I joined [Canonical](https://canonical.com/), this February, to work on Ubuntu full-time! \o/  
Those who know, they know that this is really very exciting for me because Canonical has
been a dream company for me, for real (more about this below!). And hey, this is my first
job, **ever**, so all the more reason to be psyched about, isn't it? ^_^

P.S. Keep reading and we'll meet my *squad* really sooon!


## The Story

Being an undergrad student (batch 2017-2021), I've been *slightly* worried during my last
two semesters, naturally, thinking about how's it all gonna pan out and what will I be doing,
et al, because I've been seeing all my friends and batchmates getting "placed" in companies
or going for masters or at least having some sort of "plans" for their future and I, on the
other hand, was hopelessly clueless. :D

Well, to be fair, I did [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) twice,
in [2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/6014695855620096/) and
[2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/4736285727522816/), became a
[Debian Developer](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) in 2019, been a part of
[GCI](https://codein.withgoogle.com/) and [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/), contributed
to over a dozens of open-source projects, et al, et al. So I wasn't all completely "hopeless"
but for sure was completely "clueless", heh.

And for full disclosure, I was *only* slighlty panicking because firstly, I **did** get placed
in several companies and secondly, I didn't really need a job immediately since I was already
getting paid to work on Debian stuff by Freexian, which was good enough. :)  
(and honestly, Freexian has my whole heart! üò≠‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è - more on that later sometime.)

But that's not the point. I was still confused and worried and my mom & dad, more so than
anyone. Ugh. We were all figuring out and she asked me places that I was interested to work
in. And whilst I wasn't clear about things I wanted to do (and still am!) but I was (very)
clear about this and so I told her about Canonical and also did tell her that it's a bit too
ambitious for me to think about it now so I'll probably apply after some experience or someting.

...and as they say, the world works in mysterious ways and well, it did for me! So back during
the Ruby sprints (Feb '20), Kanashiro, **the** guy (üòÑ), mentioned that his team was hiring and
has a vacant position *but* I won't be eligible since I was still in my junior year. It was
since then I've been actively prayinh for Cronus, the god of time, to wave his magic wand and
align it in such a way that next opening should be somewhere near my graduation. And guess
what? IT HAPPENED! üôä

9 months later, in November '20, Kanashiro told me his team is hiring yet again and that I
could apply this time! Without much (since there was "some") delay, I applied and started
asking all sorts of questions to Kanashiro. No words are enough for him, he literally helped
me throughout the process; from referring me to answering all sorts of doubts I had! üò≠‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è

And roughly after 2¬Ω months of interviewing, et al, my "ambitious dream" did come true and I
finalyyyy signed my contract! \o/  
(the interview process and what went on during those 10 weeks is a story for later ;))

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
