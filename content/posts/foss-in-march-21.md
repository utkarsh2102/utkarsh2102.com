Here's my (eighteenth) monthly update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 27th month of active contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March 2019 and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) on Christmas '19! \o/

This month was a bit exhausting; lots of moving parts. With the financial year ending, it was even more crazy, with me running around to banks, CA, et al.  
Anyway, with now working on Ubuntu full-time, I did little of Debian this month. Here are the following things I worked on:

#### Uploads and bug fixes:

- [polybar](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/polybar) (3.5.5-1) - New upstream version, v3.5.5.
- [ruby-http-parser](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-http-parser) (1.2.1-5) - Disable tests causing FTBFS on s390x architecture.
- [debian-security-support](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/debian-security-support) (1:11+2021.03.19) - Fix for [bug #984539](https://bugs.debian.org/984539): dpkg hook should never fail.

#### Other $things:

- Attended the Debian LTS team meeting.
- Mentoring for newcomers.
- Moderation of -project mailing list.

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
