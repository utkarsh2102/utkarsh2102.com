Here's my (fourteenth) monthly update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 23rd month of contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March last year and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) last Christmas! \o/

Apart from doing a bunch of activitites like attending KubeCon + RubyConf (blog to follow!), et al and simultaneously giving
my undergrad exams, I did (relatively) more work than I had really anticipated!

Here are the following things I did in Debian this month:

#### Uploads and bug fixes:


#### Other $things:

- Attended the Debian Ruby team meeting. Logs [here](http://meetbot.debian.net/debian-ruby/2020/debian-ruby.2020-10-02-16.37.html).
- Mentoring for newcomers.
- FTP Trainee reviewing.
- Moderation of -project mailing list.
- Sponsored `phpmyadmin`, `php-bacon-baconqrcode`, `twig`, `php-dasprid-enum`, `sql-parser`, and `mariadb-mysql-kbs` for William.

## Debian (E)LTS
{{< figure src="/images/debian-lts-small.png" >}}

[Debian Long Term Support (LTS)](https://www.freexian.com/en/services/debian-lts.html) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian security team, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.  

And [Debian Extended LTS (ELTS)](https://deb.freexian.com/extended-lts) is its sister project, extending support to the Jessie release (+2 years after LTS support).

This was my thirteenth month as a Debian LTS and fourth month as a Debian ELTS paid contributor.  
I was assigned 20.75 hours for LTS and 30.00 hours for ELTS and worked on the following things:  
(for ELTS, I worked for 5.25 hours extra, so my total hours this month for ELTS were 35.25!)

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
