Here's my (fourteenth) monthly update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 23rd month of contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March last year and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) last Christmas! \o/

Apart from doing a bunch of activitites like attending KubeCon + RubyConf (blog to follow!), et al and simultaneously giving
my undergrad exams, I did (relatively) more work than I had really anticipated!

Here are the following things I did in Debian this month:

#### Uploads and bug fixes:

- [slingshot-clojure](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/slingshot-clojure) (0.12.2-3) - Fix for [bug #891311](https://bugs.debian.org/891311).
- [clj-stacktrace-clojure](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/clj-stacktrace-clojure) (0.2.7-1) - New upstream version, v0.2.7, fixing [bug #852249](https://bugs.debian.org/852249).
- [golang-github-xo-terminfo](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/golang-github-xo-terminfo) (0.0~git20200218.454e5b6-2) - New package + source-only upload.
- [golang-github-zyedidia-tcell](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/golang-github-zyedidia-tcell) (2.0.6-1) - New upstream version, v2.0.6.
- [golang-github-zyedidia-clipboard](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/golang-github-zyedidia-clipboard) (1.0.3-1) - New upstream version, 1.0.3.
- [micro](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/micro) (2.0.8-1) - New upstream version, v2.0.8. Finally! \o/
- [ruby-zeitwerk](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-zeitwerk) (2.4.2-1) - New upstream version, v2.4.2.

#### Other $things:

- Attended the Debian Ruby team meeting.
- Mentoring for newcomers.
- FTP Trainee reviewing.
- Moderation of -project mailing list.
- Sponsored `phpmyadmin` for William and `libexif` for Hugh.

## Debian (E)LTS
{{< figure src="/images/debian-lts-small.png" >}}

[Debian Long Term Support (LTS)](https://www.freexian.com/en/services/debian-lts.html) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian security team, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.  

And [Debian Extended LTS (ELTS)](https://deb.freexian.com/extended-lts) is its sister project, extending support to the Jessie release (+2 years after LTS support).

This was my thirteenth month as a Debian LTS and fourth month as a Debian ELTS paid contributor.  
I was assigned 20.75 hours for LTS and 30.00 hours for ELTS and worked on the following things:  
(for ELTS, I worked for 5.25 hours extra, so my total hours this month for ELTS were 35.25!)

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
