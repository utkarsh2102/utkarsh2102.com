Here's my (nineteenth) monthly update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 28th month of active contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March 2019 and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) on Christmas '19! \o/

Crazy month, as always. Lots of things happening and lots of moving parts.  
Now that I am working on Ubuntu-full time, I barely get much time to do any extra stuff. Then the massive COVID wave that has plunged India had made this month further crazier. More on that later, maybe. IDK.  
Anyway, I did some Debian stuff, thanks to Salzburg BSP (more down below). I worked on the following stuff:

#### Uploads and bug fixes:


#### Other $things:

- Mentoring for newcomers.
- Moderation of -project mailing list.

## Debian (E)LTS
{{< figure src="/images/debian-lts-small.png" >}}

[Debian Long Term Support (LTS)](https://www.freexian.com/en/services/debian-lts.html) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian security team, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.  

And [Debian Extended LTS (ELTS)](https://deb.freexian.com/extended-lts) is its sister project, extending support to the Jessie release (+2 years after LTS support).

This was my nineteenth month as a Debian LTS and tenth month as a Debian ELTS paid contributor.  
I was assigned 60.00 hours for LTS and 60.00 hours for ELTS and worked on the following things:  

#### LTS CVE Fixes and Announcements:

#### ELTS CVE Fixes and Announcements:

#### Other (E)LTS Work:

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
