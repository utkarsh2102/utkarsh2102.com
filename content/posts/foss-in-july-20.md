Here's my (tenth) monthly update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 17th month of contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March last year and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) last Christmas! \o/  

Well, this month I didn't do a lot of Debian stuff, like I usually do, however, I did a lot of things related to Debian (indirectly via GSoC)!

Anyway, here are the following things I did this month:

#### Uploads and bug fixes:

- [rails](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rails) (2:6.0.3.2+dfsg-1) - Fix [CVE-2020-8185](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8185) (Closes [#964081](https://bugs.debian.org/964081)).  
- [ruby-rubocop-packaging](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-rubocop-packaging) (0.1.1-1) - Fix blank file [issue](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/issues/5).

## GSoC Phase 2, Part 2!
![](/images/debian_ruby.png#center)

In May, I got selected as a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) student for [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) again! \o/  
I am working on the [Upstream-Downstream Cooperation in Ruby](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2020/Projects/#SummerOfCode2020.2FApprovedProjects.2FUpstreamDownstreamCooperationInRuby.Upstream.2FDownstream_cooperation_in_Ruby) project.

The first three blogs can be found here:
- [GSoC Phase 1 (part 1)](https://utkarsh2102.com/posts/gsoc-phase-1/).
- [GSoC Phase 1 (part 2)](https://utkarsh2102.com/posts/foss-in-june-20/).
- [GSoC Phase 2 (part 1)](https://utkarsh2102.com/posts/gsoc-phase-2/).
- And this is GSoC Phase 2 (part 2).

Also, I log daily updates at [gsocwithutkarsh2102.tk](https://gsocwithutkarsh2102.tk/).

Whilst the daily updates are available at the above site^, Iâ€™ll breakdown the important parts of the later half of the second month here:

- [Marc Andre](https://github.com/marcandre), very kindly, helped in [fixing the specs](https://github.com/marcandre/rubocop-packaging/commit/90d23d16dff4fd00652d3e5c7f32c88d9c987225) that were failing earlier this month. Well, the problem were the specs, but I am still confused how. Anyway..
- Finished documentation of the second cop and marked the PR as ready to be reviewed.
- David reviewed and suggested some really good changes and I fixed/tweaked that PR as per his suggestion to finally finish the last bits of the second cop, `RelativeRequireToLib`.
- Merged the PR upon two approvals and released it as v0.2.0! ðŸ’–
- We had our next weekly meeting where we discussed the next steps and the things that are supposed to be done for the next set of cops.
- Introduced [rubocop-packaging](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging) to the outer world and requested other upstream projects to use it! It is being used by [13 other projects](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS0xMjY1ODQyMzQ1) already! ðŸ˜­ðŸ’–
- Started to work on [packaging-style-guide](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/packaging-style-guide) but nothing really is pushed to the public repository.
- Worked on refactoring the `cops_documentation` Rake task which was broken by the new auto-corrector API. Opened [PR #7](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/pull/7) for it. It'll be merged after the next RuboCop release as it uses `CopsDocumentationGenerator` class from the master branch.
- Whilst working on [autoprefixer-rails](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer-rails), I found something unusual. The second cop shouldn't really report offenses if the `require_relative` calls are from `lib` to `lib` itself. This is a false-positive. Opened [issue #8](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/issues/8) for the same.

## Continuation of GSoC for other Ruby related stuff!
{{< figure src="/images/ruby-logo-small.png" >}}

Thank you for sticking along for so long :)  

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
